## The project

The goal of this project is to discover, as a whole, the software platform that you have chosen through the creation of a business application.
To do this, you must implement a software suite that functions similar to that of IFTTT and/or Zapier.
This software suite will be broken into three parts : <br>

```
• An application server to implement all the features listed below
• A web client to use the application from your browser by querying the application server
• A mobile client to use the application from your phone by querying the application server
```
